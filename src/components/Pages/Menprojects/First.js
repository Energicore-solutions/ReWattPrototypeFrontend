               This artificial intelligence model predicts how much electricity solar panels and wind turbines can generate in a specific area by using weather data such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed. By analyzing factors like sunlight, cloud coverage, and wind strength, it answers the question, "How much energy can be produced in this area today?" You can enter your location to get an energy production estimate for your area and optimize energy management.
